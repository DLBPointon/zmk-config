## Sofle ZML-config
Repo containing the configs for my Sofle V2 split keyboard.

Sofle is built with a Pro Micro NRF52840 which is identical to the nice!nano v2.

### Notes:
#### 1 August - 24 August 2024 
Here my sofle had different pinouts than standard, my microcontroller burned out a pin and I was trying to reroute the trace. Turns out anything pointing to that trace doesn't either so I just need to buy a new pro-micro. I don't know why this burn out happened, I was in the middle of work and all of a sudden an entire row stopped working.

#### 24th August 2024 - onwards
Back to original pinouts.
Removed Sof config files, that has a different repo dlbpointon/zmk-config-sof
  - This is a sofle where I successfully rerouted a pin/trace.
